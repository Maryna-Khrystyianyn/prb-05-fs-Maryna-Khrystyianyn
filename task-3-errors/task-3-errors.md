# Task 3

This task practices error handling in Node.

Work in the included errors.js file. Your task is to add `try...catch` statements to prevent the program from crashing and `console.error` statements that describe to the user what happened in clear text if an error is caught.

Don't edit the existing lines of text except to indent the code.
