# Task 2

This task practices File I/O in Node.

Work in the included write.js file and complete the following:

- Create a function called `updateFile` that takes in one argument called `filename`

- `updateFile` should first read the file and store the content as a string variable

- Add a `*` to the contents of the file and then write the change to the file

- Use `updateFile` 4 times targeting `review.txt`

- Use `updateFile` targeting `star.txt` - this should throw an error and crash the program
