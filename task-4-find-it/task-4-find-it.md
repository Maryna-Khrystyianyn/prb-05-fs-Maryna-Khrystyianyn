# Task 4

This task practices problem solving focusing on File I/O, loops and conditionals.

First, examine the contents of the [data](./data/) directory.

Your task is to write a program that loops through all of the files inside and find the file that contains the word "robot". Then, print out the full path of the file.

This exercise would be easy with the `grep` terminal command, but your goal is to write a JS program to find the target file.

## Hints

- Notice that that folder and file names follow a pattern
- Nested loops are useful here
- Try `console.log("Homeowner".includes("meow"))`
- Try `console.log("Homeowner".includes("woof"))`
